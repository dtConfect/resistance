 burstcompetition.py
========================

Like competition.py, this script allows for the execution of an arbitrary number of games featuring a given set of agents. 

Permutations and combinations of agents, seating orders, and roles explored are as comprehensive as is possible in the requested number of games, with random games repeated or dropped as necessary.

------------------------
 To run competition.py:
------------------------
Refer to the notes for competition.py (competition.txt).
burstcompetition.py is operated in the same manner, except that an extra parameter, [BURSTSIZE] must be specified after [GAMES].

[BURSTSIZE] is the number of games that each 'burst' lasts for.
	- the implementation requires that the number of permutations of games per player combination must be divisible by [BURSTSIZE] with no remainder. Since scripts only currently allow for five-player games, this means that [BURSTSIZE] must be a factor of 1,200. Information about the requested game count and burst size is printed before the competition executes in order to help with this.
	
	Examples:
			burstcompetition.py 1000 600 otherBots myBotDir/ myBot001, myBot002, myBot003
			burstcompetition.py 1000 1200 myBotDir/ myBots otherBots
			burstcompetition.py 10000 20 otherBots.otherBot001 myBotDir/ myBots.myBot001, myBot002
