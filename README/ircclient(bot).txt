========================
 client.py
========================
IRC bot which represents a given resistance agent and will participate in any competitions that a server bot (ircserver(bot).txt) tells it to.

------------------------
 Environment (instructions based on Windows setup):
------------------------
client.py requires the Twisted package.
	This can be obtained from:

		<http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Downloads>
		
	However, I recommend just installing it by running:
		If setuptools* is installed:
			1. Execute "[python_installation_directiory]\scripts\easy_install Twisted"

	Twisted requires zope.interface.
		If setuptools* is installed, zope.interface can be installed as follows:
			1. Execute "[python_installation_directiory]\scripts\easy_install zope.interface"



*To install setuptools:
	Obtain ez_setup.py from:

		<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools#windows>
		(<https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py>)

	And install as follows:
		1. Simply run ez_setup.py with the version of python you wish to install it for.



------------------------
 To run client.py:
------------------------
client.py runs IRC bots for the given bots on a given server.
Refer to resistance-irc-notes.txt.

Usage at: <https://github.com/aigamedev/resistance/wiki> .

However:
"client.py [SERVER=localhost] [BOTS]" only works if [SERVER] contains "irc.", because of this:

if 'irc.' in sys.argv[1]:

	server = sys.argv.pop(1)

I may see to improving this, as this prevents the use of IP addresses and "localhost".
Currently defults to localhost anyhow, so [SERVER] can be omitted.

[BOTS] are in the format [<BOT_MODULE>.<BOT_CLASSNAME>]. Whole modules can not be imported as they can in competition.py.
